      <description>Dear Parents,
Hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. It is quite understandable that parents and students are spending anxious moments as the ICSE EXAMINATION 2020 had to be postponed by the Council due to the lockdown, moreover the uncertainty of their admission to Class XI is another area of concern. We are trying out all possible means to help out our students during this period of unprecedented crisis.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
Hope all our parents, students and their loved ones are staying safe and healthy. The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has thrown unprecedented challenges before us. One of the biggest challenges for our parents in this lockdown period is to keep their kids engaged in a constructive manner and at the same time focus on their mental well being.
Initially kids might have enjoyed the idea of being away from school but gradually as the lockdown period increased the reality of being trapped inside made them feel isolated and cut-off from their normal lives.</description>

The gamut of interdisciplinary activities shared with the teachers and the students of the partner schools added a global perspective not only to those activities but attitudes were transformed for life! ISA turned out to be a celebration of life and knowledge, a celebration which touched and transformed everyone, enriching the Teaching–Learning process.
The ISA has proved to be a journey of discovering ourselves, over reaching our capabilities and setting newer benchmarks.</description>

We, at Madhusthali, endeavour to attain this. We pluck the children young and with our pupil centric atmosphere, we apply student friendly techniques.</description>

      <description>Shri Shyam Sunder Kejriwal, a prominent entrepreneur and philanthropist, strongly felt that the development of India as a modern, progressive, prosperous, and self-reliant country depended entirely on the creation of a well-informed and educated citizenry. It was with this vision that he established M. C. Kejriwal Vidyapeeth on 15 June 1997, and created, with a missionary zeal, an institution that would, one day, under his Chairmanship, be ranked among the top ten boys’ schools in the Kolkata region (Education World Survey, 2019).</description>
