Madhusthali Vidyapeeth's purpose is to redefine the way curricula of ICSE & ISC are taught and truly harness the curriculum's potential for the benefit of young learners. 

The fight to contain the COVID19 spread has left a deep impact on all day to day functioning. With the number of Corona virus cases rising in India, schools across the country, as a precautionary measure, have been shut down, leaving a dismaying gap in the learning progress of students. 

In the wake of this fact, Madhusthali Vidyapeeth has come up with a solution to it. Our school has already started online classes for the ICSE & ISC students. 

"Because, learning must go on !"
