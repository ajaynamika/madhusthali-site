Dear Parents,

Online assignments along with supplementary e-learning materials are uploaded in the school website [www.madhusthali.edu.in](http://www.madhusthali.edu.in) for students of classes - Nursery, KG, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 & 12 (Academic session 2020-21) to compensate for the suspension of academic activities on the campus. Students can access the assignments with their log in ID and password. Final Examination Report Card for classes I to IX and XI is available online [www.madhusthali.edu.in](http://www.madhusthali.edu.in) which parents can access from home.

In this age of technology, we can reach out to the world with the touch of a button. Madhusthali Vidyapeeth is doing just that to facilitate our students and parents owing to the present pandemic situation prevailing in our state and across the country.

Kindly cooperate and stay safe.

Mr. Bitan Biswas

Principal
