##### **Notice regarding supervision of Ward's regularity and attendance in online classes**

All guardians are informed that inspite of our usual month long puja vacation, (as it happens for a residential school), the school has reopened for regular full-fledged online classes where teachers have made themselves available to conduct classes immediately after Lakshmi Puja and so are many  students who have been taking the current online classes with interest and importance. Our present normal instructional days are more than the total instructional days of an average institution or even our institution compared to years prior to 2019, since we are usually open on Saturdays, during non- vacation times.

But it has been observed that some students are deliberately not attending classes and at times remain absent for online classes without the knowledge of their parents. The school shall not be responsible for the students missing any important classes/explanations/ notice/guidelines if the students remain absent.

Hence, all parents and guardians are requested to oversee and undertake the responsibility of supervising your Ward's attendance on all working or instructional days. At least, your kind but strict supervision will be quite beneficial for your ward. Our teachers or Coordinators will contact you over the phone shortly to confirm your Ward's attendance.

Thank you,

Regards,

Principal
