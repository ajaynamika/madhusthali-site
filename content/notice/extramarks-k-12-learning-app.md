Dear Parents ,

The fight to contain the #COVID19 spread has left a deep impact on all day to day functioning. With the number of Corona virus cases rising in India, schools across the country are precautionarily shutting down, leaving a dismaying gap in the learning progress of students. 

In the wake of this fact, Extramarks has decided to give free access to its K-12 Learning App to all Extramarks enabled schools and learners till 30th April 2020. 

Because, learning must go on.

Get Free & full access to Extramarks Learning App on www.madhusthali.edu.in
