Dear Parents,

Hope all our parents, students and their loved ones are staying safe and healthy. The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has thrown unprecedented challenges before us. One of the biggest challenges for our parents in this lockdown period is to keep their kids engaged in a constructive manner and at the same time focus on their mental well being.

Initially kids might have enjoyed the idea of being away from school but gradually as the lockdown period increased the reality of being trapped inside made them feel isolated and cut-off from their normal lives. At this crucial juncture, their teachers stepped in to their world through the virtual medium and took up this challenge to shift focus from in-school learning to schooling-from-home collaboration for learners. Teachers explored the concept of **_SOLE-Self-Oriented Learning Environment_**, wherein the focus is on learners, learning at their own pace.

· Online assignments along with e-content were provided to students from Classes I to XII. Through Broadcast group and tele-counselling, the communication was kept open between the parents and the school.

· For the toddlers, work schedule was provided on every alternate day.

· Online classes for Class X and XII started from 3rd April, 2020.

· We were delighted to see how the students adjusted themselves to the classes and integrated themselves technically, to the new system of learning. Gradually, we extended the scope of online classes From Classes I to IX from 20th April, 2020.

· Teachers are also preparing answer keys for the assignments. Recorded videos of lesson will soon be uploaded on the school YouTube channel.

All these measures are taken to maintain the required pace of curriculum transaction so that students are not unnecessarily pressurized to grasp lessons at a faster pace once school reopens. Teachers are committed in their effort to deliver their lessons on this new age learning platform.

We are equally concerned about the uncertainty thrown up due to the postponement of ICSE Examination, 2020 by the Council due to the lockdown and the admission to Class XI. In order to minimize the loss of study time, we plan to start online classes for Class XI. **Thus, in spite of challenges we are going ahead with the Provisional Admission to Class XI. You may download the Admission form which is available on the school website.**

While keeping ourselves safe is our paramount objective, the economic losses incurred are also viewed sympathetically by the management. We are sure that all of you acknowledge the fact that being a private, unaided institution, we are solely dependent on the fees paid by the guardians to meet all its expenses. There are various overhead expenses which have to be incurred even when the school is closed. However, in spite of all odds we are doing our bid to alleviate the uncertainty and misery of many, which also include the parents of our children. Keeping this in mind, **the fee enhancement proposed by the school for the academic session 2020-2021 is presently being held in abeyance and the fee structure of the academic session 2019-2020 will be applicable and payable for this Academic session.**

The fee structure of the last academic session 2019-2020 is available on the school website. Fee book will be issued once the lockdown is lifted. Meanwhile, parents can pay the fee online for the month of APRIL. To further facilitate the fee payment, **the last date of fee for the month of April is extended to 10 May, 2020 without any late fine.**

**Fee will be adjusted for those who have already paid the revised fee for the month of April once the situation normalizes and the school ERP package is updated.**

We once again humbly request you to kindly bear with the present situation. Let us derive strength from each other at this moment of crisis and with the blessings of Almighty, we will soon return back to our normal lives.
