Parents / Guardians are requested to advise their wards to follow the school rules and obey the teachers at all times. **Mobiles and other electronic gadgets are not allowed in the school campus**. If found, the same shall be confiscated and **no request for returning of the same shall be entertained.**

8\. Please ensure that you have an email ID & Mobile Number which should be registered with the school office for convenient communication of notices and circulars.

9\. We are happy to inform that the academic block is now covered under 24 hr. CCTV surveillance.
