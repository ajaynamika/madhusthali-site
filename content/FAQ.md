**FAQ’S** 

**When does the academic year begin?**

The academic year begins in the first week of April and ends in the last week of March. Saturdays and Sundays-the weekends are designated holidays, though Saturdays are assigned for extra coaching classes and compulsory extra-curricular activities.

**What are the class sizes and the student-to-teacher ratio?**

Our School has small classroom sizes. And the low teacher-to-student ratio facilitates more personalized attention towards each student. The ideal number hovers around 25-30 students in each class. Small classrooms are less chaotic. Students do not get lost in the crowd and every academic behaviour is noticeable by the teacher, who can step in at any moment quite easily.

**How is the daily schedule for the students?**

One of the reasons why many parents send their children to boarding schools is that studying in a boarding school fosters a habit of punctuality. We have a specific schedule for the day, which is followed in a systematic manner. It helps to ready the children for their lifelong journey by making them disciplined and punctual.

Class III to XII 8:00 a.m. to 2: 00 pm

**What safety measures are present inside the campus?**

Boarding schools have to be safe both from a physical and emotional angle. So, along with CCTV cameras, you are right to expect round-the-clock manual security, 24 hour security Guards, vigilant wardens in the hostels and strict movement rules within the campus. The boarding school should feel like home to all students. Without adequate safety, education cannot move forward and both technology and human supervision should be in place.

**How do you deal with children who feel homesick?**

Staying away from parents is difficult. Students are bound to miss the homely environment at some point. All boarding schools must be equipped with the facility to help such students emotionally and enable them to see the brighter sides of staying in the schools. In this regard, our school also houses a counseling department with trained psychologists. The experts deal with the emotional needs of homesick students and even the parents, wherever required.

Going beyond textbooks, the school ensures students’ holistic development by exposing him to activities like quizzes, debates, elocution contests, declamation contests, recitation, essay competitions and dramatics. A diversified approach to extra-curricular, activities helps every student to find his chosen passion - be it Martial Arts (Taekwondo), Basket Ball, Soccer, Volley ball, Athletics, Painting. Art and Craft, Yoga, Music (Vocal and Instrumental), Harmonium, Tabla, Indian Classical Music are also given due importance.

**How involved will we be in our child’s education?**

Research has shown that students who had active parental involvement in their education fared better than the group whose parents showed no interest in their children’s academics.

It can be through regular visits, periodic updates or virtual meetings.
