### A COMMITTED FACULTY AND STAFF

Good teachers become great teachers by going beyond the call of duty and beyond the textbook. To do this, he or she must continue his/her education. There are conferences, workshops, and enduring education that could give our teachers that extra help in technology for their students. Madhusthali Vidyapeeth believes in the continuous up gradation of its teachers so that the students can gain maximum benefit. <br>
In addition to lesson planning, classroom performance and contribution to co-curricular activities are under constant supervision of the Administrator and the Principal who believe that quality of teaching and learning must be of the highest order day by day, hour by hour and lesson by lesson. <br>
The school is also committed to staff development through a wide range of on-going in service programmes and workshops which cover not only academics and pedagogy but also areas such as psychological counseling, personality development and career counseling. Each child receives individual attention and feels comfortable to approach teachers for help in and out of the classrooms.

### PARTNERSHIP WITH PARENTS

We understand that the parent’s active participation in the activities of the school is essential if we are to flourish as a school community. We would like the parents experience to be a positive one. Parents are informed of the school events through a newsletter and regular updating of the school’s website. They follow their child’s progress through regular and detailed school reports. The school also welcomes parents to visit the school to discuss matters of concern with the Administrator/Principal. This way we ensure that everyone contributes to the outstanding development of students.
