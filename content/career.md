### Information for Aspiring Teachers

We believe in a holistic education aimed at bringing out the best in our pupils, academically and otherwise. To us, good teachers are the key and, while we offer excellent terms, we do have a very intensive faculty selection process. We are more concerned about your potential to become a good teacher, your personality and your character, rather than merely your qualifications and experience.

So, if you love children, believe in qualitative, child-centred education and are prepared to work hard, don't be afraid to apply. If selected, you will work in the best possible teaching-learning environment, with the brightest minds in the profession. You will be professionally assessed, re-trained and orientated. You will also be exposed to best teaching practices and trained to use computer and information technology in a modern teaching-learning environment. In fact, we will do everything possible to stimulate you and hone your professional skills because we want you to enjoy your classes as much as we hope your students will.

Teachers play a pivotal role in the development of an institution. The success of a school depends to a great extent on the efficiency of the teachers. It is the teacher who transacts the curriculum and carries on the policies of the management with efficacy. If the teacher community will not be well versed with the education system of a particular organization, the progress of best of the institutions will be undermined. Thus, it becomes imperative for a successful institution, to carry on teachers’ training programs at regular intervals. Perhaps this is the reason that teachers’ training programs have been an indispensable feature of MCKV. You will be happy to join an organization where you not only grow and learn every day but would also understand and implement developmentally appropriate practices, becoming a true pedagogue in letter and spirit.
