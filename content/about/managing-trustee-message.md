With immense pride and great pleasure I welcome you at the Madhusthali Vidyapeeth. You could be a parent, a student, a staff member or anyone interested in gaining deeper insights into the functioning and learning environment of our exciting world.

I invite you to visit our stunning campus to help you understand coherently, why our school provides the best environment for your little-ones and young-adults.  Right from its inception to now, our institution has marched forward to spread the light of education and pave the path of academic excellence for every student.  The key focus areas continue to remain - creating opportunities, challenging minds, encouraging innovation and sustaining excitement.

Education is the Foundation of all progress. It is for this primary reason that we, MCKV Group ventured into school education, about 20 years ago. Over two decades of experience has taught us that advancement of the country is possible only, if both the genders of human species are equally well-educated.

The entire purpose of education is not to restrict itself to imparting bookish knowledge only for board examinations but to inculcate humanitarian values like wisdom, compassion, courage, humility, integrity and reliability in them.

So, just similar to like-minded people, we believe in holistic education for your child, encompassing-academics, co-curricular activities, sports education and life-skills learning. Our endeavor is to strike a balance between state-of- the-art infrastructure and a globally acceptable education.

At MV, we impart education that is based on conscience and we rear a breed of young minds that are bustling with self confidence, motivation and ever ready to take up challenges.

The Madhusthali campus itself with huge sports and academic facilities all bear testimony to this effort. In order to endorse an internationally acceptable education, our key focus has been on teacher development â€“ providing continuous Training, Workshop, in-house Seminars, Smart classes and all of these only to deliver real value education and excellence in academics. Our Teachers are trained not only to teach well but are also expected to inspire confidence and trust in their students and **become role models**. Further, the School inculcates in the students a respect for traditional value systems and ensures discipline and good manners.

Our School encourages students to learn about themselves and their constantly changing environment with adverse moment, while at the same time offering motherly support and guidance as they practice decision-making and social skills.

**We are confident that this residential school is the best place for your child**. We welcome your active interest and involvement in the progress and activities of your child. We look forward to your continuous support.

In conclusion let me quote **Sri Aurobindo**:

> It is by a constant inner growth that one can find a constant newness and unfailing interest in life. There is no other satisfying way.
