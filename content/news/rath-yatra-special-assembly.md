On the auspicious day of Rath Yatra special assembly was conducted by the students of Aravali house on 4th July,2019 in Madhusthali Vidyapeeth. The chariot was decorated and a banner on Rath Yatra was prepared by students of class VIII, IX and X.

The assembly started with Gyatri Mantra followed by National Pledge and then a short speech was delivered by Faria Hamid, student of class XI focusing on grand celebration of Rath Yatra festival in Odisha .

‘Rath’ means chariot and ‘Yatra’ means trip or journey. The cultural harmony of Odisha is reflected in the Rath Yatra festival. After the assembly the chariot was drawn by students of class II and III in school campus and at last the journey of Lord Jagannath was ended at school temple.

After school hours the hostel students also drew the chariot towards MITT campus and came back with the chariot. All the students enjoyed the Rath Yatra festival very much.![](/uploads/2019/12/12/IMG-20190704-WA0029.jpg)![](/uploads/2019/12/12/IMG-20190704-WA0033.jpg)![](/uploads/2019/12/12/IMG-20190704-WA0073.jpg)
