Children's Day which is also the birthday of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our first Prime Minister of India was celebrated online as a tribute to him. 

Pandit Nehru was known for his relentless effort to increase awareness of the rights, care and education of children.

And today's Online program showcased the outstanding talents of our teachers who gave artistic performances for the students in order to exhibit their love and affection for them. 

The online program was led by Ms. Shikha chourasia and  Mr.Tabrej Haider. 

Initially, our Principal sir delivered a short sharing on the significance of Children's Day. It was followed by " A Dance enactment on food habits '. 

The program was enlightened by a video display on 'Cleanliness Drive.'

Based on the aspects of Online schooling, an online skit was displayed featuring our teachers enacting the role of students  which was something very entertaining. Students were truly excited and thrilled to witness their teachers in student's avatar and laughed their hearts out at their humor. 

A solo by Ms. Priya Das also added glamor and color thereon. A motivational poem which was recited by Ms. Smriti Chatterjee captivated everyone.

Then there came the moment to reminisce some sweet memories which was compiled using the yester years photo collage through a video display.

Students and all the virtual audience had a gala moment marking the day a memorable one.
