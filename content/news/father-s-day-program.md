This program was conducted by Nilgiri house students, teachers and staff of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth where all students and parents were present during the online program.

Mohammad Saif Alam of Std. VII presented a heart touching speech in Hindi. Another beguiling oration by Sambhavi Singh of Std. VIII depicted her love and dedication of a father towards the family.

The posters displayed by the students showed the love and affectionate bonding of the father with their sons and daughters.

Zerat Zeya of Std. III recited a beautiful poem.

A video presenting the enactment of Ujjwal Kumar of Std.VI and his father depicted a beautiful chemistry between a loving father and the child.

Thereafter, a dance performance by Vidhi Dalmia of Std. IX and Kaviya Dalmia of Std. V was fabulous.

Towards the end, our Principal, Mr. Bitan Biswas, expressed his joy and happiness as a role of a father and expressed, "A dad is someone who wants to catch before you fall and when you fall he picks you up, brushes off the dirt, and lets you try again. Your father is your real life hero and your best friend too."
