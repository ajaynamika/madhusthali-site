Madhusthali Vidyapeeth organized An Online Inter House English Recitation Competition for Junior section (Std.III - V) on 29th August 2020. Children got an opportunity to exhibit their talent and confidence. The competition inspired the children to come forward and recite .

The children came up with different poems on the topic: - “MOTHER, “NATURE “and “PATRIOTISM” and recited them with great zeal and enthusiasm.

The participants from all the respective four houses – Aravalli, Nilgiri, Shivalik and Vindhya, left no stone unturned to win for their house. Students were judged on parameters like confidence, voice modulation, the props used and on the overall presentation.

A warm welcome address was delivered by Ms. Neha Jain, Asst Teacher of MV and anchoring was fantastically done by Pratibha Modi of Std. VI.

The final judgment was made by Mr. Samgeet Mondal and Mrs. Rubi Kumari of the English Department.

From class V, Om Vibhor Pandey of Aravalli House bagged the first position, whereas, Shlesha of Class IV from Vindhya House secured the second position and from Class V again, we have Ayush Verma of Shivalik House stood third in the competition.

The judges appreciated and applauded the performance of the participants and the feeling of patriotism filled the air with love and respect for our motherland.

The special attraction was the filler program performed by the students of Std. I to V. They danced and rhymed beautifully with their amazing skills.

Summing up of the programme was wonderfully done by our honourable Principal Sir. In his speech, he encouraged our little ones to hone their literary skills and come forward to exhibit them and by ending up the programme we have Vote of Thanks beautifully delivered by Mrs. Sanjeeda Khatoon.
