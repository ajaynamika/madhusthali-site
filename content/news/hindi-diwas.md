Hindi Diwas is celebrated on September 14 to pay tribute to the official language of India.

The students and staff of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth celebrated Hindi Diwas online and offline to mark the importance of the country's most widely spoken language which was hosted by our cherishing host Ms. Guncha Firdous of std. VIII.

The celebration began with Master Navnit Kumar of Std-X 'A' who spoke on the significance of Hindi Diwas. Master Dilip Kumar of Std. XII also highlighted the importance of the day by Hindi Dohas.

Students from std-VI to IX displayed their heart warming spirit by making posters to celebrate Hindi Diwas.

Our Sanskrit teacher Mr. Dwarika Prasad Singh also shared his thoughts on the occasion highlighting insight and the importance of Hindi Dohas in our daily life and urged everyone to feel proud of our National language Hindi.

Ms. Riddhima Pandey of Std. VIII rendered a poem on the origin of the Hindi language. Thereon, the program witnessed a well choreographed dance performed by Ms. Shagun Modi of std. V and Ms. Pratibha Modi of std. VII which was indeed an inspiration and delight to the eyes. Last but not the least the celebration concluded with a positive note by our Hindi teacher Mrs. Lata Singh.
