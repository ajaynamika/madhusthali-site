**Horse Riding**

Madhusthali Vidyapeeth has been consistent in keeping up to our commitments and being the only school in Deoghar Zone, we have introduced horse riding facilities for our students. Our main aim behind this endeavour is to uplift the status of this sport, up to the next level. We have the best horse riding coaches who train our students.

This horse riding experience is simply a few minute’s ride around the paddock, lead by our coaches. Nonetheless, it is always a pleasure to see the joy on each little face as the children experience the ride.

As a child progresses in their horse riding skills, they develop self-confidence and self-assurance. Horse riding offers a great workout for both the mind and body, physically boosting the cardiovascular system and easing stress in the mind. Today, where children are exposed to so much external stimuli, they need healthy, and relaxing down time. As a child progresses in their horse riding skills, they develop self-confidence and self-assurance.

Horse riding isn’t only a sport, also help students to build a loyal relationship and a sense of trust with their horse. The students also learn to care for animals.
