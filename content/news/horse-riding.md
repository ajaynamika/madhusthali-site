**Horse Riding**

Madhusthali Vidyapeeth has been consistent in meeting the commitments of the students as for the first time in Deoghar Zone we have introduced horse riding facilities to our Madhusthalians. For this, we have started giving horse riding lessons to our students. Our main aim behind this Endeavour is to uplift the status of this sport up to the next level. We have best horse riding coach with us to train our students in a professional way. 

Horse riding isn’t only a sport, although, it’s a great form of exercise that also help students to build a loyal relationship and a sense of trust with their horse. It’s also considered as the noble initiative taken by the school to let students learn care for an animal. 

We are proud to say that we are working successfully in the directions of achieving our goals.
