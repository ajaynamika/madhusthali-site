Self instruction activity was conducted in the Pre Primary section. All the students from classes Nursery-II actively participated in the activity. The objective of this activity was to help even the shyest students to open up a bit and try out to express themselves and communicate in English and develop language skills in the classroom.

Students took an opportunity to come forward and introduce themselves and speak about their families in front of everyone. Through this activity students got a chance to know each other. Moreover, they learn to speak confidently in front of everyone.
