**PARENTS ORIENTATION PROGRAMME**

**“A parent is a teacher at home and a teacher is a parent in school and the child is the centre of our universe.”**

Under the able guidance of our Respected Vice- Chairman and our Principal, an Orientation Programme was organized for the parents of new admissions of class XI at the multi-purpose hall on 25th June, 2019. The aim was to familiarize the parents, “as partners in progress” with the curriculum, rules and regulations of the school, teaching methodologies and the co-scholastic activities.

The program commenced with a warm welcome to the parents by our Respected Vice-Chairman and Principal ma’am addressing the gathering. In their speech, they laid stress on effective communication between the teachers & the parents and also sought their support and suggestions so that the children could be provided the best for their overall development.

Thereafter, a power point presentation on the flash back of the session 2018-19 was presented by Mr. Suraj Bose (Middle School Coordinator) followed by a brief note about our school by Md. Jawed Equabal (Science Teacher). The parents were briefed about the vision, objectives and the rules and regulations of the school.

Our Administrator, Mr. Aubrey Thompson, then took over the stage who oriented the parents with a wonderful power point presentation displaying the importance of Parents-students- teachers relationship. He also shared guidelines about effective parenting with a strong bonding with the teachers in future. He also suggested different measures to nurture a child with love and care to build a strong foundation for a glorious future.

Thereon the orientation was enlightened by the presence of respected Mr. Amitabh Mohan (Director- HLS India) who, with his unique, creative and entertaining way shared the basic ethics of true parenting and a good student. He also stressed on the different teaching methodologies and conveyed a message of right approach in different situations. His sharing was highly effective as it made everyone who were present there to participate which was something new and refreshing for the new parents and students.

The orientation program ended with a vote of thanks by Mrs. Shabnam Parween -Junior Coordinator. The Orientation proved to be a sincere effort made by the school in educating the parents to look after and guide their children in a proper manner. It is a firm belief that it will help in evolving a common teaching strategy and also help the parents in identifying suitable follow up methods to reinforce the learning process of their children.
