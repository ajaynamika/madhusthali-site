No life is possible on this earth if mothers were not there. From carrying in her womb to make us what we are, a mother sacrifices all her personal wants and comforts. To honour such sacrifices the Vindhya House of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth organized an online assembly dedicated to mothers all over the world.

Sharp at 8 o'clock in the morning, Respected Principal Sir, the Co ordinators and the teachers, students along with their parents made their gracious presence in the Zoom platform to attend the online assembly organized to offer respect to mothers , the first teacher, friend, philosopher, guide and even psychologist for everyone ever born.

The program hosted by Sanju Kumari of class XII and Rudraneel Chatterjee of class VII saw a bunch of blooming buds of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth celebrating the auspicious day with their own talent and creativity.

The beautiful words from Kavya Dalmia of class V set the tone of the assembly. Her sweet voice and the sweeter words reflected that mothers are incarnation of the God on earth. Mother and God are inseparable. From dawn to dusk mothers play a vital role in our life and this is what was presented by Slesha through a graceful recitation of an English poem in the Assembly. Mothers are really “the sun and the moon” in our lives.

It is the fingers of the mother that we hold when we start walking, she always protects us from every suffering for we are her “ladla” and this was presented by an enactment performed by Joydeep. Adarsh Ghutgutia’s melodious voice, singing to praise the mothers and motherhood added to the rhythm of the day’s Assembly. And finally, the Assembly saw a colourful display of posters made by the students of the Vindhya House. The creativity, no doubt, “made the assembly brighter and the day truly memorable.”

The words of Respected Principal Sir touched the heart and soul of everyone present today. Indeed, no words can describe and define mother and motherhood. Mothers are indeed “the most precious gift” that we have in our lives.
