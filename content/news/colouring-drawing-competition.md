A Drawing Competition was organized for Nursery to VIII. It was a day where we saw studentsâ€™ creativity exploding in every piece of art. It was a wonderful opportunity to think out of the box. The competition not only served its sole purpose but also gave them a platform to display their vivid ideas and learn more by interacting with others in displaying the beautiful blending of colours. It also enhanced awareness amongst students as students were highly excited to show their creativity. The Competition was held in various categories.

The Topics for the Competition were:

Junior Category : Nursery to II (Colouring)

Middle Category : III to V (Own choice)

Senior Category : VI (Rongoli)

Class VII  : (Save Water)

Class VIII  : (Global Warming)
