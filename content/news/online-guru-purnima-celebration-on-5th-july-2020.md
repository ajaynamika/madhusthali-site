**GURU PURNIMA CELEBRATION AT MADHUSTHALI VIDYAPEETH 2020**

**Guru Purnima** is a tradition dedicated to all the spiritual and academic Gurus, who are evolved or enlightened humans, ready to share their wisdom with very little or no monetary expectation, based on Karma Yoga.

In keeping with the tradition of revering the gurus for their invaluable contribution in shaping the minds and characters of young people, the students of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth observed Guru Purnima for their beloved teachers on July 5, 2020.

All the enthusiastic students paid their tribute to their gurus by many activities under the guidance of their Art and Music Teacher. During this pandemic period, students from various classes submitted their artworks painting, singing and speech regarding guru & Guru Purnima. Students: Arvadeep from class 1 Kirti Anupal forms standard 8 and Rudra Pratap from class V etc delivered short speeches regarding guru or teachers. There Harshit Modi from Standard 4, Sambhavi Kumari from class 3 Rudra Pratap Sahu from class 5, Antara kumari from standard 8 submitted the beautiful artworks also. Even Anushka Roy from class nine Prisha Chatterjee from class 6 Shreya Ghoshal from class eight performed attractive dances relating the auspicious day. Om Vibhor Pandey from standard 5 nicely presented a song paying tribute to gurus. Later all these activities are assembled by Mr. Prasun Bagchi and he made an enjoyable video. Students and teachers from home observed the day with enormous wishes and blessings. Principal of MV Mr. Bitan Biswas congratulated all the students for their best activities and performances.

Madhusthali Vidyapeeth also has kept alive the lamp of 'Guru Tatva' , year after year to reaffirm its strong belief in the Guru- Shishya 'parampara'.

May the gurus continue to shine and be the guides and torchbearers of the society.
