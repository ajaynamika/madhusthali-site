A wonderful session on Dramatics was conducted as the students were seen in the best of their spirits.

**Morning Session (Dramatics):**

The Session was based on the introduction of theatre and its ethics. Students were shown videos and clippings of various forms of dramas on the topic “Intimate Space”.

It was indeed a wonderful and unique experience for them as they were given a task to answer as to why were they interested in taking part in Dramatics? The students have been assured that it has been just a beginning and would be meeting soon. With a positive vibe and high spirit the session ended with sharing from the student’s end.

**Afternoon Session - Communication Skills (Class 6-11):**

Two afternoon sessions on Communication Skills for the hostellers from Class VI-XI was taken up by Mr. Janardhan Ghosh (MCKV).

Initially it started with general interactions and thereafter exchange of opinions also took place.

The Session for the juniors started with a PowerPoint presentation on various types of noises and sounds with a video clipping of classroom atmosphere.

The second session with the seniors continued with activities pertaining to body language and sign language. They were made to understand that in dramatics 70% of the communications is done with the body movements and 30% through verbal communication.

It ended with an interesting game and interaction
