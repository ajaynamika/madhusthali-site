Altogether 11 (Eleven) Commerce students of classes X & XI were escorted by Mr. R.K Thakur (Commerce Department) to visit the HDFC bank, Madhupur Branch . It was their maiden visit to a bank where the Branch Manager Mr. Vivekanada Roy greeted everyone warmly.

Getting to grip with the idea of monetary value and the different denominations of bank notes is one of the financial lesson which we aimed at while taking our students for a visit to bank. The duration of the visit was 1 hour for the entire briefings.

The students were explained the difference between nationalized and private banks and learnt that the corporation bank is a nationalized bank. They also got acquainted with the opening of the bank accounts, filling of pay in slip to deposit money, withdrawal of money through Cheque. They were very curious to know about how and where the money is stored and how the ATM machines are refilled. The Branch Manager was quite helpful and provided the students with some practical and handsâ€“ on knowledge of basics functionalities. He also answered all the queries put up by the students and told them about the networking of the bank with other branches. Overall, it was a knowledgeable trip.
