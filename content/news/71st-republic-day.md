The 71st Republic Day was celebrated on January 26 at the Madhusthali Vidyapeeth stadium. The students took pride in glorifying and celebrating the spirit of unity and brotherhood. The event began with the hoisting of the Indian National Flag by the Honorable Chairman, Mr. Kishan Kumar Kejriwal along with the CEO Mr. Parthasarathi Chakraborthy, the Principal of MV, Mr. Bitan Biswas, the Principal of MITT, Mr. Deependra Nath, the Education Officer Mr. Ambarish Chatterjee and the Project Manager, Mr. R. K. Singh, followed by the National Anthem. The students of the four houses and the students of Scouts & Guides marched in their colourful uniforms rhythmically to the patriotic tunes played by the school band.

The Honourable Chairman in his address highlighted the significance of the day, and made the children aware that the future of their country lies in their hands. Hence, they need to study well now and inculcate good values in life, which will help them to be good citizens of the country. Honourable CEO and Principal MITT also delivered valuable speech and explained the significance of the day.

Miss. Talat Yasmin of Class XI welcomed the gathering, while Miss Fariya Majid of Class XI delivered a Speech in Hindi. The school echoed with patriotic fervour as the children of Class IV-VIII danced to the tunes of patriotic songs, offered wonderful patriotic rendition of ‘_Ae watan watan mere Aabad rahe tu, Main jahan rahun Jahaan me yaad rahe tu_.”, and even dressed in their tri-coloured clothes to mark the occasion. Vote of thanks was delivered by Miss. Priya Bharti of Class XI. The program ended with a Retreat March.

Our school band along with MV Parade team and Scouts & Guides participated in the March Past at Dakbangla ground that was organised by the district administration like the previous years. It is a matter of pride that MV Team won the Second position and honoured with a Trophy and certificate.

We are also proud of another Madhusthalian, Master Ritesh Ranjan of Class VIII as he won Silver Medal in State Level Taekwondo Championship. He was also recognised and honoured with medal, memento and certificate in the same Republic Day Ceremony.
