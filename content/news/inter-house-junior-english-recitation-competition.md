Beauty is the realm of poetry, children enjoy the beauty of expression, thoughts, feelings, rhyme, rhythm and music of words.Taking this into consideration, Madhusthali Vidyapeeth organised a Recitation Competition for the Pre-primary and Primary students (Classes Nur-V) on Monday, 8th August, 2022 in the MITT Auditorium. As, Madhusthali Vidyapeeth gave students the opportunity to exhibit their talent and confidence, the competition inspired the students to come forward and recite their verses with great zeal and enthusiasm.

There were were two participants from each of the four houses from every class from classes 3, 4 and 5 who got the chance to recite their verses on three different themes - 'Smile' for the students of class 3, 'Kindness' for the students of class-4 and 'Peace' for the students of class 5.

All total 18 students came up with different poems on given themes and recited them with great fervour and enthusiasm. The contestants from all the respective four houses â€“ Aravalli, Nilgiri, Shivalik and Vindhya left no stone unturned to win for their house. Participants were judged on parameters like body language, gesture, articulation, voice modulation, self confidence, dramatic expression and pronunciation. The final judgment was made by the judges Mrs. Vinita Bose and Mrs. Soniya J Prasad. We also had our tiny tots from Nursery to II taking part in the recitation with lot of zeal.

Certificates were awarded to all the winners by our Principal, Mr. Bitan Biswas after the competition was over. In his speech, he encouraged students to hone their literary skills and come forward to exhibit them.
