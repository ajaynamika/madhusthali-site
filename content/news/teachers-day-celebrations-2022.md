Beautifully choreographed dances blended with moral message, hilarious but lesson well learned drama by senior students and soulful melodies were the main attraction of the day. 

Students from classes III to XI displayed a tremendous amount of energy to make our day.

They didn't leave any stone unturned as they captivated every one with their flawless performance. All the teachers had a wonderful time with the cheerful students.

The second segment of the program was a gathering of all the three Units Faculty led by Campus Administrator and Senior School Coordinator which comprises classic Bollywood & Devotional songs, jokes, poems on Teachers and inspirational messages.

It was quite reviving as our Respected Principal-MITT took the stage and mesmerized everyone by her soulful voice.

The short program ended with a gift presentation for all the three Units Faculty and sumptuous lunch.

On behalf of the entire Madhusthali Campus three Units would like to extend our heartiest thanks to the Management for your support and the wonderful gift.![](/uploads/2022/09/10/20220906_102416.jpg)![](/uploads/2022/09/10/img-20220906-wa0002.jpg)![](/uploads/2022/09/10/20220908_080536.jpg)![](/uploads/2022/09/10/20220908_080101.jpg)![](/uploads/2022/09/10/20220908_080031.jpg)![](/uploads/2022/09/10/20220908_080324.jpg)![](/uploads/2022/09/10/20220908_080616.jpg)![](/uploads/2022/09/10/20220908_080444.jpg)
