On the auspicious morning of 26th January, 2021 our school celebrated the Republic Day on the school ground. It was a matter of great pride for all of us. Needless to say, the whole school had worn the appearance of a beautiful bride.

The Principal, teachers and the students didn't want to leave any stone unturned in making this monumental day a memorable one in this Pandemic time with such a limited number of students in campus. The Principal of all the three institutes of our campus along with the administrators were the Guests of Honour. They were warmly welcomed by the whole staff led by our Principal.

Our hon'ble guests unfurled the national flag. After that everybody stood up in attention for the National Anthem led by the choir group of the senior school.

The Education Officer of MCKV group Mr. Ambarish Chatterjee, the Principal of MITT, Mr. Deependra Nath and the Administrator of MIPS, Mr. Dilip Kr. Jha delivered inspiring speeches invoking the precious contribution of our great freedom fighters.

The choir group of school along with teachers sang a melodious song, "_Dil diya hai jaan bhi denge ae watan tere liye_... "

Mahima Marandi and Master Saswat of Class X recited a beautiful poems in Hindi and English respectively.

The whole programme was beautifully anchored by Ms. Sakshi Bathwal of Class XII.

Towards the end of the program, vote of thanks was delivered by the Principal of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth, Mr. Bitan BIswas.

Despite the inclement weather, we enjoyed the Republic Day with great enthusiasm. The students who have witnessed the program live from home had also enjoyed the day with the same fervor.

The live program was followed by a short video which comprised some outstanding performances by the students of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth including songs, dancers and paintings.
