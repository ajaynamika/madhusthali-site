Prior to the Republic Day Celebration, Vasant Panchami Utsav, ie,  Saraswati Puja, was ceremoniously celebrated. The staff and students of all the three units led by our Hon'ble Chairman Sir and Principals of MV, MITT, MIPS came together on this auspicious day of Vasant Panchami, which also marks the advent of the Spring Season and start of preparation for Holi, about 40 days before spring, for the worship and to offer prayers and pushpanjali and participate in the havan to seek blessings from the goddess of learning and music and symbol of hope, energy and prosperity.

Such a celebration in our Madhusthali Campus, during such customs and festivals, reverberates the spirit of togetherness and strengthening bond amongst students and teachers and in turn also teaches us learn the qualities of team work, leadership and cooperation.![](/uploads/2023/01/27/5.jpg)![](/uploads/2023/01/27/6.jpg)![](/uploads/2023/01/27/7.jpg)
