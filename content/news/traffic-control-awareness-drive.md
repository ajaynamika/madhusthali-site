**MADHUSTHALI VIDYAPEETH BHARAT SCOUTS & GUIDES** 

 **TRAFFIC CONTROL AWARENESS DRIVE**

The Madhusthali Vidyapeeth Bharat Scouts & Guides led by Scout Master, Mr. Suraj Bose and Guide Mistress Mrs. Vinita Bose, met our hon'ble SDO, Madhupur Sri. Aashish Agarwal at his office on 20th February 2023 and flagged off the Traffic Control Awareness Drive

The Traffic Control Awareness Drive was led by our Madhusthali Vidyapeeth Scouts & Guides where they took on the Madhupur public, imparting latest Traffic rules and  guidelines issued by the Government of India for the safety as well as for the safety of pedestrians.

Our Hon'ble SDO, Madhupur also urged the general public to cooperate with the administration in the implementation of the traffic rules for the road safety not only in letter but also in spirit. 

On behalf of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth family, we extend our heartiest thanks to the Madhupur Administration and our Madhusthali Vidyapeeth Scouts & Guides for putting up such an educational initiative![](/uploads/2023/02/23/41a9c753-a2a5-40f1-b2a9-8ed4db9b3834.jpg)
