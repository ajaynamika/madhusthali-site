Clay modelling is a great way to help children to develop imagination and spark creativity. Our school organized clay modelling activity for the class K.G. to II, Wherein the students participated enthusiastically. It enhanced their gross motor skills and creativity.

Through this activity students discovered how to make basic forms, develop hand â€“ brain coordination, agility and fine motor skills. Practising the art of clay modelling gives children many opportunities to be creative and can also result in longer attention spans.

At the end of the activity, many beautiful creations of children were seen on each table of every class. The activity was a wonderful opportunity for students to explore skills.![](/uploads/2019/12/04/IMG-20190809-WA0022.jpg)![](/uploads/2019/12/04/IMG-20190809-WA0017.jpg)![](/uploads/2019/12/04/IMG-20190809-WA0028.jpg)![](/uploads/2019/12/04/IMG-20190809-WA0023.jpg)
