Madhusthali Vidyapeeth, Celebrated Christmas day with great fervour and enthusiasm. The entire school vibrated with the echoes of Christmas Carol and Christmas medley by students of Class IV- VII.

The Pre-primary wing wore a festive look with bells, streamers and a beautiful decorated Christmas tree. The tiny tots of classes Nursery to II had performed a wonderful dance. The children were told about the birth of Lord Jesus and the legend of Santa Claus. The spirit of giving and sharing was inculcated with the show of exquisitely packed gifts. There were songs and dances related with New Year. Everybody enjoyed each and every item. Christmas songs were being sung by Classes VIII, IX and XI students along with the calling on of the New Year â€“ 2020.

Madhusthali Vidyapeeth's Principal has given a lovely Christmas Greetings that contained the message of love and unity and caring and sharing with all wishes for the New Year - 2020. The boundless joy of celebrating the festival was amply visible on the faces of the children especially when Santa moved around distributing chocolates to them.

The Administrator of Madhusthali Vidyapeeth, expressed his joy for the lovely presentation and proposed the vote of thanks.
