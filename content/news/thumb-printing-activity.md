**‘Thumb Printing Activity’** was conducted in pre- primary section to boost our students’ artistic skill. This activity helped students to build hand-eye coordination, muscle control and dexterity. Moreover, it allows the young child to work with the medium, moving it around, blending it and creating anything from an abstract expression to explore their own creativity. It was based on various topics like Bunch of flowers, Vegetable, Insects, Electronic gadgets, Scenery etc. The Activity Program ended with great success.
