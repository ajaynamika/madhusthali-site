On 14th Nov, 2019 Madhusthali Family, celebrated Children's Day in a grand manner commemorating 130th birthday of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. Teachers took the role of the students for theday as they conducted the special assembly with the saraswati vandana, the Shlokas, the Speech, the Day's Thought and the News headlines. The morning section celebrated the day with great fun and the little talents performed various characters through Fancy dress. The teachers staged a variety of programmes in a row. The programme began with a prayer song by the teachers followed by a medley of songs, Quiz and Antakshari. The middle section students performed a gala dance. The show of the day was a musical comedy skit performed by the teachers based on various students' feats in classroom atmosphere. Thus, the whole day was a day of fun and frolic after a short academic sesion in the first part of the morning. In the end, our Honourable Principal delivered an inspirational speech. The programme marked grand success with great endeavour of the teachers with short period of practice after school during the week.  It needs to be mentioned that our school band performed a grand Band March Past at the welcome ceremony in the Balmela at the Railway Football Ground, Madhupur, which was highly appreciated.
