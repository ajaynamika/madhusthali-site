**RAKSHA BANDHAN CELEBRATION 2020**

Raksha Bandhan is one of the most endearing ways to celebrate the bond between brothers and sisters . To strengthen this bond Madhusthali Vidyapeeth also celebrated this festival this year on 3rd August 2020. Students of various classes participated with great enthusiasm. In this lockdown situation They used their home with decorative thread, stars, mirrors, pearls and flowers for making beautiful rakhiâ€™s to celebrate it.

Madhusthali believes that such celebrations of festivals with true sprit teach students about our Indian traditions. All their home bound activities were assembled and a beautiful video was presented to all. Our Honourable Principal Sir appreciated the performance of the students.
