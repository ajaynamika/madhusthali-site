      <description>Dear Parents,
Hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. It is quite understandable that parents and students are spending anxious moments as the ICSE EXAMINATION 2020 had to be postponed by the Council due to the lockdown, moreover the uncertainty of their admission to Class XI is another area of concern.

      <description>Dear Parents,
Hope all our parents, students and their loved ones are staying safe and healthy. The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has thrown unprecedented challenges before us. One of the biggest challenges for our parents in this lockdown period is to keep their kids engaged in a constructive manner and at the same time focus on their mental well being.
Initially kids might have enjoyed the idea of being away from school but gradually as the lockdown period increased the reality of being trapped inside made them feel isolated and cut-off from their normal lives.</description>
